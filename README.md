So far this is a port of `ipycli` to work with the newest ipython master. For the time being this will require the `ipycli_port` branch of `dalejung/ipython`. I will try to backport features that are mergable into `ipython`.

# Features TODO

* `standalone` handler from `ipycli`. Allows ipython to serve pages that connect to kernel but don't exist within the notebook interface. **ipycli backport**
* Gist backend **ipycli backport**
* Support multile views of project folders. **ipycli backport**
* Enable vim mapping + extended `ipycli` vim mapping. **ipycli backport**
* Add last modified column to notebook **ipycli backport**
* other things I'm forgetting.

# nbx cli tools
